                <b>Spice Pyramid</b>
                <br/><br/>
                You’re a museum guide in an Egyptian area of the museum. You’re one day giving a guide to patrons and one of them asks if they can touch the painting. You had been told explicitly that no they can never touch the painting. 
                <br/><br/>
                They touch it despite what you say and they end up jumping into the painting.
                <br/><br/>
                You have to decide whether to help them or not. Go in or instead continue your normal life as a museum instructor.
                <br/><br/>
                You enter this world and you are a merchant. Your wife (the person who jumped in) is pregnant and you are both staying in a hotel. You have a pouch of 150 coins and it takes 100 coins for each day you stay. You need to go out and make it as a merchant by trading with the villagers. You want to get enough money to unlock this time capsule that can free you
                <br/><br/>
                You set up shop and you are selling spices. When you run out of spices, you have to buy more from farmers.
