                <b>You Are A Worm</b>
                <br/><br/>

                You are a worm in the year 2080. Birds do not exist anymore. Worms have evolved to the point where they have their own transit system. 
                <br/><br/>

                You decide one day to catch a bus to the next big city nearby, leaving all your worm friends behind. 
                <br/><br/>

                In this new worm city, you meet a bird. In your old town, they were thought to be extinct, but here you are: you met one. You realized your life was a lie. 
                <br/><br/>

                You and this worm fly to your hometown to spread the news, but then you are seen as a crazy person and thrown into worm jail.
                <br/><br/>

                You and this bird are being framed for overthrowing the worm government. You need to find a way to convince the worm public that you and this bird did not assassinate the worm president. 
                <br/><br/>

                How will you figure it out? Send me an email with your strategy. dieter@serenidad.app
