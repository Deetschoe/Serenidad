                <b>Hacker House</b>
                <br/><br/>
                Hacker houses are really interesting. They sound quite fun. Imagine you're employed at a Hacker House with 15 people and your job is to mentor them and to make them meals.
                <br/><br/>
                You begin to form relationships with the characters in the game and hear the type of projects they're working on and invest. They have some days that are good and others that are horrible.
                <br/> <br/>
                The conversations are all AI-generated, but we set up the model in such a way that you give advice and it has a real impact on the character, their mental state, and the outcome of their projects.
