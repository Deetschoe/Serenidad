                <br/><br/>

                    Someone is killed at a cat cafe called Spill The Beans. You are recruited as an investigator to figure out who killed the person.  
                    <br/><br/>

                    You need to take with customers and look through clues to figure out who killed the customer and why.
                    <br/><br/>

                    Along this journey you get to befriend customers and exit the cafe to talk with them and go bike riding.
                    <br/><br/>

                    Over the adventure, you come to find that the person who died was named Saffron. They were a frequent customer.
                    <br/><br/>

                    Saffron was frequently quite stressed about many things in their life. They put themselves in a situation where they had a lot of debt (both social and financial).
                    <br/><br/>

                    You befriend Saffron's younger sister (19yr old and you are 18yr old). You learn that she is trying to avoid the mistakes that Saffron made that led to their death. 
                    <br/><br/>

                    You discover that Saffron had hired an assassin to kill her to get life insurance claim to help her family and to pay off debt.
                    <br/><br/>

                    You have a choice to either go with Saffron's younger sister on a flight to their home town and to put the ashes into a river or to report the insurance fraud and the money be denied to the family.
